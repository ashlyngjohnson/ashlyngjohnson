### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Ashlyn Johnson**, my pronouns are she/her/hers, and I'm a Neuroscience PhD Candidate at Emory University. 

#### Overview
**Undergraduate Institution: North Carolina State University**
- B.S. Biological Sciences with a Concentration in Integrative Physiology and Neurobiology, 2017 
- Minors: Biotechnology & Cognitive Science 
- Undergraduate Research: Co-authored four publications with the [Meitzen Lab](https://meitzenlab.wordpress.ncsu.edu/) at NC State and completed two Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships with the [Diamond Lab](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/diamond/) at UT Southwestern. 


**Graduate Institution: Emory University**
- PhD Candidate in the Neuroscience Graduate Program 
- Member of the [Hales Lab](http://haleslab.github.io/) where I study the contribution of astrocytes to frontotemporal dementia. 

You can view a current list of my peer-reviewed publications [here](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6129-8267).

#### Interests
In the lab, I'm interested in studying the contributions of astrocyte and astrocyte endfeet to tau-related frontotemporal dementia. I am broadly interested in the blood brain barrier, glymphatics, astrocyte homeostasis, and tau biology. 
Outside of the lab, I am working to strengthen my skills in R, python, and SQL.
